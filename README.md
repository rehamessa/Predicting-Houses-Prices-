## THIS IS the  [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction) which is usind in these notebooks  ##
## [Notebook](https://github.com/rehamessa/Predicting-Houses-Prices-/blob/main/Predicting_Houses_Prices_using_ML_Algorithms.ipynb) i used regression algorithms and the accuracy of each one LinearRegression accuracy is 70%,Ridge accuracy is 70%,ElasticNet accuacy is 62%,DecisionTreeRegressor accuacy is 76%,KNeighborsRegressor accuracy is 52%,RandomForestRegressor accuracy is 88%,and finally GradientBoostingClassifier is 86%.  ##
##  through the past results, we could say the best algorithm is  RandomForestRegressor.  ##
